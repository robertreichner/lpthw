You experience tremendous confusion.
You experience a gap and see the the possibility of another way.
You decide you need to calm your mind and learn to meditate.
You start meditating and gain some peace.  
Then you see that others have the same problem and you long to help them.
But you don't have enough resources.
So you gain merit and develop prajna.
Then you begin to help others calm their minds and cultivate virtue.
But this takes too long. 
So you enter the vajrayana.  
You meet a teacher and receive lung, wang, and tris.
You practice tantra and visualization practice.
You continue to help others.
You cultivate virtue and windhorse.
Finally you establish a good human society on this earth.
